Regularization [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics))

详细内容参考Wikipedia
In mathematics, statics, and computer science, particularly in the field of machine learning and inverse problems, **Regularization** is a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting.

In general, regularization is a technique that applies to objective functions in ill-posed optimization problems.

Regularization can be motivated as a technique to improve the generalizablity of a learned model.
